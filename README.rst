Drishti MCQ Engine
=========

MCQ Engine for Drishti'12

#. TODOs

1.Change username to drishti id

2.Remove password from login. Better to set a default password than removing the password field. Removing password field, makes Django authentication impossible to authenticate without proper 'backend'

3.Remove 'bash' , 'python' from question types

4.Add negative marking

5.Renovate the HTML file in templates folder. Drishtify its looks!

PM for admin username and password. Or remove exam.db and run 

#. $> python manage.py syncdb

Once the dev model is ready, we can work on deployement! Start woking! :)
